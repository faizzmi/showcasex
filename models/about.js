export const story = `
I believe every project has the potential to transform and impact the world in meaningful ways. That’s why I focus on creating innovative web and mobile applications that spark curiosity, foster engagement, and leave a lasting impression. My process is rooted in understanding user needs, collaborating effectively, and transforming ideas into intuitive and powerful solutions.

While I specialize in front-end development and enjoy the creative challenges of building responsive, interactive websites and applications, I’m also learning 3D manual drawing and have experience in computer drafting. Whether I’m coding with Angular and React or exploring the world of 3D design, my passion for creating seamless and visually appealing products extends beyond just development—it’s about designing for the future.

I’m also deeply interested in artificial intelligence which drives me to explore its integration into applications for smarter, user-centric solutions. I developed an AI-based system to calculate car distances, earning two prestigious awards and showcasing the potential of combining innovation with real-world needs.
