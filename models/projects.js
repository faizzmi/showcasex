The Sobel edge detection algorithm identifies areas of rapid intensity change, which correspond to edges, allowing the system to locate object boundaries in real-time. The distance measurement is derived from the spatial relationship between these detected edges, providing an estimate of how far objects are from the camera or sensor. The system's accuracy and effectiveness are enhanced by incorporating preprocessing techniques to address challenges like illumination changes, and segmentation methods to handle multiple objects or occlusions, ensuring precise and reliable distance calculations across different environments. This combination of edge detection, real-time processing, and spatial recognition features offers a robust solution for applications like autonomous vehicles, robotic navigation, or augmented reality.",
