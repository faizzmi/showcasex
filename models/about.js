export const story = `
I believe every project has the potential to create meaningful impact. That’s why I focus on developing innovative web and mobile applications that enhance user experiences, improve efficiency, and solve real-world problems.

As a frontend developer, I specialize in building responsive, interactive, and user-friendly interfaces using modern frameworks like React and Next.js. I continuously refine my skills, exploring new technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Beyond web development, I’m also keen on artificial intelligence and its practical applications. I developed an AI-powered distance measurement system for smart cars, earning recognition with a Silver Award at CITREX 2024. This experience reinforced my passion for leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges.

I may not have years of experience, but I am highly motivated to learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully to impactful projects. Every challenge is an opportunity to improve, and I embrace that journey wholeheartedly.
